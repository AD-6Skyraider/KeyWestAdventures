# KeyWestAdventures
Coding playground and real Itinerary for a Key West Florida Adventure Vaction for personal use.
I have used this project for a while. Since starting to code. Many things won't make sense. 
Like having random words bolded and/or italicized. Or tables, lists, etc. I'm just practicing.
I want to develp this further. Probably more than an actual site like this needs to be but I'm
going to practice with other things. 
This is the reason my initial Git Commit is so filled.
